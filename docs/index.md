I’m a PhD student at Saarland University in Vera Demberg’s lab. My work focuses on the role of relational and contextual cues in processing discourse relations, but I am interested in anything remotely related to this. In my research, I often combine various psycholinguistic tasks (e.g. self-paced reading, comprehension) to test my hypotheses. These hypotheses are often inspired by corpus research and cognitive models of language processing. 

I am affiliated with the DFG-funded SFB 1102 Project ["Information Density and Linguistic Encoding"](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/), working on project B2 ["Cognitive modelling of information density for discourse relations"](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/projects/cognitive-modelling-of-information-density-for-discourse-relations/) and with the ERC-funded project ["Individualized Interaction in Discourse"](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/individualized-interaction-in-discourse-iddisc.html).

Take a look at my [publications](https://marianmarchal.github.io/publications) or current research [projects](https://marianmarchal.github.io/projects) to learn more about my research.
