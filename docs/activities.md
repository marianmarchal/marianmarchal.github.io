**DiscoMatiX**\
*Since October 2023*

DiscoMatiX is an interest group for researchers working on discourse and pragmatics using experimental approaches. Our goals are to assess how different frameworks are (not) compatible and to develop best practices to empirically test theoretical predictions. 
The group will be kicked off with an online mini-series.
